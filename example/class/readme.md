# Example 2: Using closures to implement classes

Showcases one of the many uses for closures.

## Usage:
Running `gcc *.c && ./a.out` should print:
```
mc = 0
mc = 1
```

## Files:
- [myclass.h](myclass.h): Defines the public interface of a class named `MyClass`
- [myclass.c](myclass.c): Contains the implementation of `MyClass`
- [main.c](main.c): A short driver program showcasing the use of the class `MyClass`
- [clsr.c](clsr.c): Translation unit implementing the library
